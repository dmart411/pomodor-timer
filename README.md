The Pomodoro Technique is a technique to maximize productivity be chunking intense studying into 25 minute blocks followed by 5 minutes of rest 

This application allows user to slect between classic mode, where there is a 25 minute timer, or custom mode, where the user can select how long they want their work session to be.
Also allows user to choose between a short and long break. 
When timer runs out, a random song from a list of some of my favorite songs is opened in the users browser.
